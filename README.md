# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository includes the Class 1 survey dataset and R code used to
analyze it. The project is part of an exercise to practice working with real-
world data in R.

## Files Included
- `classSurv.csv`: Cleaned version of the Class 1 survey dataset
- `analysis_code.R`: R script used to summarize and visualize the data
- `README.md`: This file

## What the Code Does
- Reads in the survey dataset
- Performs basic data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, filtering)
- Creates summary statistics (e.g. factor, integer, numerical, and character variables, bday and month)
- Checks the bday and bmonth variables for any unusual or missing values
- Creates new variable (bseason) and provides statistics on number on students in each season
- Stratifies birth season by educational level to determine which season has the highest number of medical doctors

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open `analysis_code.R` in RStudio
3. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are
saved
4. Run the script
